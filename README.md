# Sloth Clicky Game

This project is a memory game created with React. The application's UI is broken into components with states managed.  

The application renders 12 different images of sloths to the screen. Each image listens for click events. The player must click all 12 images, but cannot click the same image more than once.

The application keeps track of the player's score. The player's score is incremented when an image is clicked for the first time. The player's score is reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page shuffle themselves in a random order.

Once the player's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game will restart.

In addition to scoring the current game, the player's top score is also rendered in the top right corner.
